Method

<p>Graphology developed along a few independent methods. Nowadays the situation can thus be described:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>French method</em>, based on the work of J. Crepieux-Jamin, and integrated with key ideas con Germany (Klages, Heiss, ...) and Switzerland (Pulver), is used throughout Europe.</li>
<li>The <em>Italian Method</em>, closely modelled on the work of G. Moretti, is mostly used in Italy and Spain.</li>
<li>In the United States there are several schools based on M. Bunker's <em>Graphoanalysis</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The French/european method</h1>
<p>
The specificity and strenght of the french/european method rests in the <strong>global</strong> and <strong>simbolic</strong> approach to handwriting, which is integrated only in a second step by an <strong>analytic</strong> one.<br/>
Handwriting is not seen as a neuro-psycho-biological byproduct<span class="footnotemark">†</a>, but first and foremost as the result of the "directive image".

In this <a href="file/IntroGrafo.pdf">pdf</a> (italian only) one can find a brief introduction to Graphology according to the French/european school.

<div class="footnote"><span class="footnotemark">†</span> It is <em>also</em> that, and as such it must be studied when necessary. In forensic graphology, for instance.</div>
