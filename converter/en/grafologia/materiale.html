<p>The graphologist needs a handwritten document on a black A4, not ruled sheet.<br/>
The writer should use his normal style (printed, cursive, â€¦) and his preferred writing instrument in his preferred color. Some more paper put under the writing sheet makes it easier for the graphologist to appreciate the pressure.
</p>
<p>The text of the manuscript is irrelevant, but should be spontaneus: copying from another source might change some features of handwriting.</p>

<p>It is preferable to also analyse</p>
<ul>
<li>notes on scrap paper;</li>
<li>a few documents from earlier on (5, 10, 15 years ago, for instance).</li>
</ul>

<p>Graphology <em>cannot</em> deduce from handwriting either sex or age or level of education or profession. This is data that is required for the analysis, and must be told to the graphologist.</p>

<p>It is often useful to analyse (graphologically) also some <em>drawing tests</em>. The following ones are among my favourites.</p>

<h1>The landscape test</h1>
<p>Also called <em>the four elements test</em>. It requires an A4 sheet of paper. The instructions are:<br/>
<em>Draw a landscape containing a house, the sun, some water and a snake</em>.
</p>

<h1>The star-wave test</h1>
<p>It requires an A5 sheet of paper on which a frame has been drawn, more or less half inch from the border. The instructions are:<br/>
<em>Draw the starry sky over the waves of the sea</em>.
</p>

<h1>The trees test (Stora)</h1>
<p>The instructions are interactive and cannot be written here.
