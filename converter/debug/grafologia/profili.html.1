Personality portraits

<p>Be it a gift for someone close to you, or rather a means of finding out something about yourself, a personality portrait based on a graphological analysis is often an occasion for introspection and for getting to know someone better.</p>
<p>The graphologist strives to give people insights and knowledge, but with a <em>narrative</em> rather than a psychological language.</p>
<p>Each personality has a thousand facets, and the graphologist can not see and describe them all. The portrait, hence, focuses on the few essential aspects&thinsp;â€”&thinsp;those that shape all the rest.</p>
<p>Undestanding how these colorful threads combine to form the complicated tapestry that is everyone's personality is a useful tool to best descrive be overall picture.</p>
